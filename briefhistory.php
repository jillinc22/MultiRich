			<h1>BRIEF HISTORY:</h1>
			<p>In 1999, MULTIRICH's Wafer Division launched its flagship brand, Superstix. Its initial offering of chocolate wafer sticks was soon followed by milk, tutti fruity, pandan and mocha flavors as it progressively gained a strong standing amongst its competitors. The company ventured into cream paste snacks in 2000 with the launch of Krimstix. The division's portfolio was then expanded in 2001 with the introduction of Jumpee bite-size wafers in to the market. Seeing its potential, the division was readied to become a separate company. 2002 saw the birth of <b>MULTIRICH FOODS CORPORATION</b> with the opening of its plant in Marilao, Bulacan.
